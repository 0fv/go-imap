	// authentication mechanism name and "initial response" data (if required by
	// the selected mechanism). A non-nil error causes the client to abort the
	// authentication attempt.

	// A nil ir value is different from a zero-length value. The nil value
	// indicates that the selected mechanism does not use an initial response,
	// while a zero-length value indicates an empty initial response, which must
	// be sent to the server.
